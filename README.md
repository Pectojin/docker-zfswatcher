# zfswatcher
Zfswatcher container for monitoring the Zettabyte File System

Based on [crazymanjinn/docker-zfswatcher](https://github.com/crazymanjinn/docker-zfswatcher) but using [rouben's build](https://github.com/rouben/zfswatcher) because it's now the leading repo ([damicon repo](https://github.com/damicon/zfswatcher) hasn't been updated since 2013)
